Chapter 20 Check Point Questions
Section 20.2
▼20.2.1
What is a data structure?
A data structure is a collection of data organized in some fashion. In object-oriented thinking, a data structure is an object that stores  other objects, 
referred to as data or elements. So some people refer a data structure as a container object or a collection object. To define  a data structure is essential to
declare a class.

▼20.2.2
Describe the Java Collections Framework. List the interfaces, convenience abstract classes, and concrete classes under the Collection interface.
The Java Collections Framework defines the Java API for handling common data structures tasks in Java. It defines classes and interfaces for storing and 
manipulating data in sets, lists, and maps. A convenience class is an abstract class that partially implements an interface. The Java Collections Framework 
defines interfaces, convenience abstract classes, and concrete classes.

▼20.2.3
Can a collection object be cloned and serialized?
Yes a collection object can be cloned and serialized. The concrete classes of Set, List, and Map implements the clone() method in the Cloneable interface.

▼20.2.4
What method do you use to add all the elements from one collection to another collection?
addAll(Collection c).

▼20.2.5
When should a method throw an UnsupportedOperationException?
If a method has no meaning in the subclass, you can implement it in the subclass to throw java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException, a subclass  of 
RuntimeException. This is a good design that you can use in your project. If a method has no meaning in the subclass, you can implement it as follows:
public void someMethod() {
throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Method not supported");
}

Section 20.3
▼20.3.1
How do you obtain an iterator from a collection object?
The Collection interface extends the Iterable interface. You can obtain an iterator from a collection using the iterator() method.

▼20.3.2
What method do you use to obtain an element in the collection from an iterator?
Use the next() method.

▼20.3.3
Can you use a foreach loop to traverse the elements in any instance of Collection?
Yes.

▼20.3.4
When using a foreach loop to traverse all elements in a collection, do you need to use the next() or hasNext() methods in an iterator?
No. They are implicitly used in a foreach loop.

Section 20.4
▼20.4.1
Can you use the forEach method on any instance of Collection? Where is the forEach method defined?
Yes you can use the forEach method on any instance of Collection. It is defined in the Iterable interface which is a super interface for Collection.

▼20.4.2
Suppose each element in list is a StringBuilder, write a statement using a forEach method to
change the first character to uppercase for each element in list.
list.forEach(e -> {
if (((StringBuilder)e).length() > 0) {
char ch = ((StringBuilder)e).charAt(0);
if (Character.isLowerCase(ch)) {
((StringBuilder)e).setCharAt(0, Character.toUpperCase(ch));
};
};
});

Section 20.5
▼20.5.1
How do you add and remove elements from a list? How do you traverse a list in both directions?
Use the add or remove method to add or remove elements from a list. Use the listIterator() to obtain an iterator. This iterator allows you to traverse the list 
bi-directionally.

▼20.5.2
Suppose that list1 is a list that contains the strings red, yellow, and green, and that list2 is
another list that contains the strings red, yellow, and blue. Answer the following questions:
a. What are list1 and list2 after executing list1.addAll(list2)?
b. What are list1 and list2 after executing list1.add(list2)?
c. What are list1 and list2 after executing list1.removeAll(list2)?
d. What are list1 and list2 after executing list1.remove(list2)?
e. What are list1 and list2 after executing list1.retainAll(list2)?
f. What is list1 after executing list1.clear()?
list2 is not changed by all these methods.
a. list1 is [red, yellow, green, red, yellow, blue]
b. list1 is [red, yellow, green, [red, yellow, blue]]
c. list1 is [green] What is list1 and list2 after executing list1.remove(list2);
d. list1 is [red, yellow, green]
e. list1 is [red, yellow] What is list1 after executing list1.clear();
f. list1 is empty

▼20.5.3
What are the differences between ArrayList and LinkedList? Which list should you use to insert and delete elements at the beginning of a list?
ArrayList and LinkedList can be operated similarly. The critical differences between them are their internal implementation, which impacts the performance. 
ArrayList is efficient for retrieving elements, and for adding and removing elements from the end of the list. LinkedList is efficient for adding and removing 
elements anywhere in the list.

▼20.5.4
Are all the methods in ArrayList also in LinkedList? What methods are in LinkedList but not in ArrayList?
All the methods in ArrayList are also in LinkedList except the trimToSize() method. The methods getFirst, getLast, addFirst, addLast are in LinkedList, but not 
in ArrayList.

▼20.5.5
How do you create a list from an array of objects?
A simple way to create a list from an array of objects is to use
new ArrayList(Arrays.asList(arrayObject))
or
new LinkedList(Arrays.asList(arrayObject)).

Section 20.6
▼20.6.1
What are the differences between the Comparable interface and the Comparator interface? In which package is Comparable, and in which package is Comparator?
The Comparable interface contains the compareTo method and Comparator interface contains the compare method and equals method. Normally, if the objects of a 
class have natural order (e.g., String, Date), let the class implement the Comparable interface. The Comparator interface is more flexible in the sense that it 
enables you to define a new class that contains the compare(Object, Object) method to compare two objects of other classes. The Comparable interface is in the 
java.lang package, and the Comparator interface is in the java.util package.

▼20.6.2
How do you define a class A that implements the Comparable interface? Are two instances
of class A comparable? How do you define a class B that implements the Comparator
interface and override the compare method to compare two objects of type B1? How do you
invoke the sort method to sort a list of objects of the type B1 using a comparator?
How do you define a class A that implements the Comparable interface?
public class A implements Comparable<A> {
public int compareTo(A o) {
return an integer;
}
}
Are two instances of class A comparable? Yes.How do you define a class B that implements
the Comparator interface and override the compare method to compare two objects of type
B1?
public class B implements Comparator<B1> {
public int compare(B1 o1, B1 o2) {
return an integer;
}
}
How do you invoke the sort method to sort a list of objects of the type B1?
list.sort(new B());
To sort an array x of objects of the type B1, use
java.util.Arrays.sort(x, new B());

Which method can you use to sort the elements in an ArrayList or a LinkedList? Which method can you use to sort an array of strings?
You can use Collections.sort(list) to sort an ArrayList or a LinkedList and use Arrays.sort (Object[]) to sort an array of strings. For example,
LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
list.add("Java"); 
list.add("Python"); 
list.add("C++");
java.util.Collections.sort(list); // Sort the list
String[] languages = {"Java", "Python", "C++"};
java.util.Arrays.sort(languages); // Sort the array

Section 20.9
▼20.9.1
How do you create an instance of Vector? How do you add or insert a new element into a vector? How do you remove an element from a vector? How do you find the 
size of a vector?
Vector is the same as ArrayList except that Vector contains the synchronized methods for accessing and modifying the vector. Since Vector implements List, you 
can use the methods in List to add, remove elements from a vector, and use the size() method to find the size of a vector. To create a vector, use  either its 
constructors.

▼20.9.2
How do you create an instance of Stack? How do you add a new element to a stack? How do you remove an element from a stack? How do you find the size of a stack?
Stack is a subclass of Vector. The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out stack of objects. The elements are accessed only from the top of the stack. You can
retrieve, insert, or remove an element from the top of the stack. To add a new element to a stack, use the push method. To remove an element from the top of the 
stack, use the method pop. To find a stack size, use the size() method.

▼20.9.3
Does Listing 20.1, TestCollection.java, compile and run if all the occurrences of ArrayList
are replaced by LinkedList, Vector, or Stack?
Yes, because these classes are subtypes of the Collection interface.

Section 20.10
▼20.10.1
Is java.util.Queue a subinterface of java.util.Collection, java.util.Set, or java.util.List? Does LinkedList implement Queue?
java.util.Queue is a subinterface of java.util.Collection, and LinkedList implements Queue.

▼20.10.2
How do you create a priority queue for integers? By default, how are elements ordered in a priority queue? Is the element with the least value assigned the 
highest priority in a priority queue?
Use the constructors of PriorityQueue to create priority queues. By default, the elements in a priority queue are ordered in their natural order using the 
compareTo method in the Comparable interface. The element with the least value is assigned the highest priority in PriorityQueue.

▼20.10.3
How do you create a priority queue that reverses the natural order of the elements? 
new PriorityQueue(initialCapacity, Collections.reverseOrder()).
